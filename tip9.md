# Use gists to share snippets and pastes

GitHub “gists”—shared code snippets—are not a Git feature, but they use Git. All gists are Git repositories, and GitHub Gist makes it easy to share them. You can search Gist for public gists by topic, programming language, forked status, and starred status. You can also create secret gists and share them by URL.
