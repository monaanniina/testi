While merges with Git usually work well, if you do them without thinking, you can occasionally encounter difficulty. Step one is to make sure you have no uncommitted changes. From the git merge manual page:

Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are conflicts. See also git-stash.
