# Git/GitHub tip No. 3: Commit early and often
A commit is a granular update to a project, which includes one or more changes to one or more files. Think of it as a record of a unit of work completed, which can be applied to or removed from the project as a logical whole. Do commit every logical change you complete, even before testing it. Commits only apply to your local repository. See tips No. 4 and 5 for corollaries to this tip.

The definition of git commit from the manual page:

> Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the user describing the changes.
