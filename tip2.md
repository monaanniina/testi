# Git/GitHub tip No. 2: Pull frequently
One of the easiest ways to make a mess for yourself with Git (and indeed, with any version control system) is to allow files to get out of sync. If you git pull frequently, you will keep your copy of the repo up to date, and you will have the opportunity to merge your changed code with others’ changes while the merging is easy to understand and accomplish—ideally, when it’s so easy that it can be done automatically. A corollary of this tip is to watch your project status. Many Git clients will automatically show you when you need to update to stay current.
