# Branch freely

One of the biggest advantages Git has over some other version-control systems is that merging usually works well, at least partly because Git automatically chooses the best common ancestor to use for a merge. Most software developers need to start creating branches in their projects more often. It should be a routine daily occurrence, not the subject of an anguished all-hands strategy meeting. The likelihood is that, when the branch project is complete, accepted, and ready to move into the main project, the merge will not present any insurmountable problems.

I know that takes some adjustment, especially if you’ve been stuck in a company that does source code control with CVS. But try it. It’s a whole lot better than having customers accidentally see your unfinished experimental code when the trunk project has to be published because of a breaking bug. (This article explains basic branching and merging well.)
