# Explore GitHub

Many interesting open source projects have repositories on GitHub. Explore GitHub provides a browsing interface to find some of them, but mostly it’s easier to type a few letters of the project’s name in the search box to find its repos. For example, type jq or back or ang to find three of the major open source JavaScript frameworks.
