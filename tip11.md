# Use editors and IDEs that “git it”

If you’re barreling along on an edit only to discover, when you go to check it in, that someone else has been working on the same code as you have, you’re likely to become frustrated. You can avoid or at least minimize that frustration by using an editor or IDE that integrates Git and actually tells you that the code you’re viewing has new commits that you should pull, and what the new commits are supposed to accomplish.
